###ReactJs Calculator App

-full working calculator app in reactjs+bootstrap

-written in lack of time,so I kind of cheated in styling stuff I adjusted values to form perfect grid that you can see in live version of this app.
Correct way is to build more div elements dynamically according to needs....though it works great.
